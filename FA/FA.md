# CVE-2022-4262

Author: Jack Ren ([@bjrjk](https://github.com/bjrjk))

This V8 CVE is the one of the most difficult and non-trivial type confusion vulnerability I've ever met since I started to study JavaScript engine vulnerabilities. It has spent me more than two full weeks and numerous spare time to analyze this bug and try to find an exploit. However, I was only able to accomplish a [root cause analysis (in Chinese)](../RCA/RCA.md) because of having no time to investigate this vulnerability anymore. That's really a pity I didn't have time to figure out the exploit myself.

However, the pity is finally settled down after @mistymntncop using his brilliant intelligence to develop an exploit. This exploit is so tricky and artful that I cannot suppress my thrilled feeling! @mistymntncop is really an V8 codebase auditing genius to develop this fragile exploit! [This](https://github.com/mistymntncop/CVE-2022-4262) points to [@mistymntncop](https://github.com/mistymntncop)'s exploit repo.

In order to preserve his precious thought and commemorate my time on this unruly CVE, I decide to write a full analysis on the vulnerability. This write up will divide the whole exploit process into different stages, each described in a section in this article, to make you readers easier to understand.

The article will be mainly made up of the following [6](TODO: Number of Section) technological sections:
- [Overview](#overview): Because of the complicated root cause and the long exploit chain, an overview will be presented to help you have a rough understanding of this CVE and its possible attack impacts.
- [Proof of Concept](#proof-of-concept): This section delivers information about proof of concept, its runtime output and its sketchy runtime logic.
- [Root Cause Analysis](#root-cause-analysis): We'll figure out the root cause of this uncommon type confusion in function's feedback vector. This vulnerability is due to strictness mismatch in execution context, i.e. scope.
- [Simplified Exploit](#simplified-exploit): A simplified exploit will be provided and introduced to readers to make a better understanding of the formal exploit's key point.
- [Exploit Primitive in V8 Sandbox](#exploit-primitive-in-v8-sandbox): This section contains the JavaScript source utilizing the vulnerability to achieve Address-Of, Fake-Object, Read & Write Primitive in V8 Sandbox. Meanwhile it will also describe why the source's capable to do so.
- [Exploit for RCE (Possibly)](#exploit-for-rce): The insight to enlarge primitives in V8 Sandbox to Remote Code Execution in this specific vulnerability version of V8 will be presented.

Each section, except Overview, will contain multiple subsections. They are typically starting with background knowledges, then source code (PoC, Exploit) or patch, which is followed by a technology analysis upon it. Finally, a conclusion will summarize the whole section.

Now, let's start with Overview for CVE-2022-4262!
